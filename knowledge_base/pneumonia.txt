Overview
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired outside of a hospital or healthcare setting. It is a common and potentially serious illness, especially in older adults and those with comorbidities. The diagnosis is typically made by the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography combined with clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, sputum production, and pleuritic chest pain.

Diagnosis and Evaluation
Diagnosis is based on clinical features and a new infiltrate on a chest radiograph. Key clinical features include fever, cough, sputum production, and pleuritic chest pain. Physical examination may reveal tachypnea, tachycardia, rales, or signs of consolidation.

Severity Assessment (CURB-65): The CURB-65 score is used to stratify mortality risk and determine the treatment setting (outpatient vs. inpatient vs. ICU).

C - Confusion (new disorientation)

U - Urea (BUN > 20 mg/dL or 7 mmol/L)

R - Respiratory Rate (>= 30 breaths/min)

B - Blood Pressure (Systolic < 90 mmHg or Diastolic <= 60 mmHg)

65 - Age (>= 65 years)

Scoring:

0-1 points: Low severity, consider outpatient treatment.

2 points: Moderate severity, consider hospital admission.

3-5 points: High severity, manage in-hospital; consider ICU admission if score is 4-5.

Management by Severity
Low-Severity (Outpatient):

No comorbidities: Amoxicillin (1g 3x daily) OR Doxycycline OR a Macrolide (Azithromycin 500mg on day 1, then 250mg daily).

With comorbidities (e.g., heart, lung, or liver disease): Combination therapy with Amoxicillin/clavulanate PLUS a Macrolide or Doxycycline, OR Monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., Levofloxacin 750mg daily).

Moderate-Severity (Inpatient, non-ICU):

Standard: Beta-lactam (e.g., Ceftriaxone 1-2g IV daily) PLUS a Macrolide (e.g., Azithromycin 500mg IV daily).

Alternative: Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy.

High-Severity (ICU Admission):

Standard: Beta-lactam (Ceftriaxone) PLUS a Macrolide (Azithromycin).

If Pseudomonas risk: Use an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g., Piperacillin-tazobactam, Cefepime, or Meropenem) PLUS a fluoroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin).

Recent Research (2024-2025)
Recent 2024-2025 clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of lung ultrasound (LUS) in diagnosing CAP, finding it has a higher diagnostic accuracy than chest radiography in some settings. Furthermore, recent studies on antibiotic duration suggest that for most non-severe CAP, a 5-day course of antibiotics is non-inferior to longer 7- or 10-day courses, promoting antibiotic stewardship.
