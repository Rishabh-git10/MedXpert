## Overview
A "lung lesion" typically refers to a **Solitary Pulmonary Nodule (SPN)**, which is a discrete, round opacity in the lung that is 3 cm (30 mm) or less in diameter. A lesion larger than 3 cm is defined as a "lung mass" and is treated as malignant (cancerous) until proven otherwise.

SPNs are very common and are often found incidentally on CT scans. While the vast majority (over 95%) of small nodules are benign (e.g., old scars, granulomas), the primary goal of management is to determine if a nodule is malignant (lung cancer).

## Diagnosis: Risk Stratification
The entire diagnostic process is based on **risk stratification**. This involves assessing two key areas: patient risk and nodule characteristics.

**1. Patient Risk Factors:**
* **High Risk:** Advanced age, heavy smoking history, personal or family history of lung cancer, exposure to asbestos.
* **Low Risk:** Younger than 35, non-smoker, no other risk factors.

**2. Nodule Characteristics (on CT Scan):**
* **Size:** This is the most important factor.
    * `< 6 mm`: Very low risk of malignancy.
    * `8-20 mm`: Intermediate risk (33-64% malignant).
    * `> 20 mm`: High risk (64-82% malignant).
* **Density:**
    * **Solid:** A dense, uniform nodule.
    * **Subsolid (Ground-Glass):** A hazy, see-through nodule. A persistent subsolid nodule has a *higher* chance of being malignant (typically a slow-growing adenocarcinoma) than a small solid nodule.
* **Borders:**
    * **Benign:** Smooth, well-defined borders.
    * **Malignant:** Irregular, "spiculated" (spiky), or "lobulated" borders are highly suspicious.
* **Calcification:**
    * **Benign:** Specific patterns like central, laminated (onion-skin), or "popcorn" (hamartoma) calcification are definitive signs of a benign nodule.
* **Growth Rate:**
    * **Benign:** A solid nodule that has been stable (unchanged in size) for **2 years** is considered benign and requires no further follow-up.
    * **Malignant:** Cancers grow. Any new growth on a follow-up CT is suspicious.

## Management: The Fleischner Society Guidelines
Management is a step-by-step process based on nodule size, density, and patient risk.

* **For Low-Risk Patients, Solid Nodules:**
    * `< 6 mm`: No routine follow-up is recommended.
    * `6-8 mm`: A single follow-up CT scan at 6-12 months is considered to ensure stability.
    * `> 8 mm`: Follow-up at 3 months, or consider a PET/CT scan or biopsy.

* **For High-Risk Patients, Solid Nodules:**
    * `< 6 mm`: A follow-up CT at 12 months may be considered.
    * `6-8 mm`: Initial follow-up at 6-12 months, and if stable, another at 18-24 months.
    * `> 8 mm`: High suspicion. Requires a 3-month follow-up CT, a **PET/CT scan** (to check for metabolic activity), or a **biopsy** (tissue sampling).

* **For Subsolid Nodules (Ground-Glass or Part-Solid):**
    * These have different rules because they are often slow-growing adenocarcinomas.
    * They require a longer follow-up period, often **up to 5 years**, to confirm stability. Any growth or development of a new solid component is highly suspicious and requires biopsy or resection.

## Recent Research (2022-2024)
The **2017 Fleischner Society Guidelines** remain the undisputed standard of care for managing incidental nodules. Recent reviews in *JAMA* (2022) and *American Family Physician* (2023) have reinforced this risk-based, serial-CT follow-up approach. The key innovation is not a change in the guidelines, but the increasing use of **AI and quantitative models** to more accurately calculate a nodule's "probability of malignancy", helping clinicians make better decisions within the Fleischner framework.
